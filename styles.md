## <small>THIS IS A HEADER</small>

This is the font, size, color and spacing of regular ol' paragraph <p> text. Using Markdown makes it dead simple
to make text *italic*, **bold** or ***bold and italic***.

If you want to reference a footnote it appears like this[^1] in a sentence.

Quotes look nice:

>"My fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once, too."

So do tables:

| This          | Is A          | Table |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Column 1      | happens to be | left-aligned |
| Column 2      | is the one    |  that's centered |
| Column 3      | is actually    |    right-aligned |

Here are the buttons whose class names and colors can be easily customized:

<span class="added">added</span> This span class is named "added" but you can change it.

<span class="removed">removed</span> This span class is named "removed" but you can change it.

<span class="improved">improved</span> This span class is named "improved" but you can change it.

<span class="fixed">fixed</span> This span class is named "fixed" but you can change it.

<span class="soon">coming soon</span> This span class is named "soon" but you can change it.

If you include any inline `code` it looks awesome.

A code block highlights the [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)) and displays the language:

{% highlight ruby %}
def test(a=1,b=2,c=a+b)
  puts "#{a},#{b},#{c}"
end
test        =>  1,2,3
test 5      =>  5,2,7
test 4, 6   =>  4,6,10
test 3, 4, 6   =>  3,4,6
{% endhighlight %}
