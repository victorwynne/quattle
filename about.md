Noir is a modern, responsive and customizable theme for Jekyll 4 that I began developing in 2019. It is available on GitHub under an MIT license. Typography is paid close attention to and a dark mode friendly color scheme will be displayed automatically depending on your deviceâ€™s settings. It builds upon a standard Jekyll install in a number of useful ways.
