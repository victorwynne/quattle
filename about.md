Quattle is a modern, responsive and customizable theme for the static site generator Jekyll. Typography and design aesthetics are give the full attention they deserve. A light or dark color scheme will be displayed automatically depending on a device's settings. It builds upon a standard Jekyll installation in a number of ways that are important to both writers and software developers.

It is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/victorwynne/quattle) under an MIT license.

This project was originally released in 2019 as [Noir](https://github.com/essentialenemy/noir) but various issues including but not limited to 2FA made that repo inaccessible. Every attempt to communicate these access issues to GitHub (read: Microsoft) and rectify the situation were unsuccessful. Live and learn, right?
