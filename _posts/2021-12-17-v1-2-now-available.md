#### Changelog for v1.2.1

Mistakenly (read: stupidly) used an uppercase letter Q for the gem name, yanked the previous gem versions and renamed it properly. Updated README.md and about.md to reflect this change.

#### Changelog for v1.2

Created a GDPR valid and compliant cookie consent banner that appears at the bottom of the page. An accompanying privacy page has also been included

Add `{ % include yourscriptfile.js % }` to line 35 of `cookie-consent.html` in order for your script to run and cookie(s) to be created after the notice is accepted

Updated Ruby gem to v1.2
