## <small>Changelog for v1.3.0</small>

**Added:** a tag cloud!

**Added:** a fresh coat of paint!

**Fixed:** a number of header tags that weren't consistent across pages

**Changed:** if no color scheme is requested the default is now `dark`

**Improved:** various visual tweaks and refinements to both light and dark mode

**Improved:** tags are now styled on posts and on the tags page

**Improved:** archive displays the number of posts per month, year, category, tag

**Improved:** the external URL listed for the `link:` front matter will display the base domain as a source reference at the bottom of posts and link to the full URL

**Removed:** the related posts feature. Visually it became quite a busy mess at the bottom of each post; tags, source reference, footnotes, previous/next entries. Functionally it wasn't that useful because it relied on `site.related_posts` which is time based only. Working on an alternate implementation.
