>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

The post title can link to an external URL and the base URL of that link is automatically listed as a source reference. I styled this with a right arrow but it is very simple to change or disable this from displaying. The Atom feed will by default reference the website permalink rather than the external URL.
