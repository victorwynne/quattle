## <small>Download</small>
[GitHub](https://github.com/victorwynne/quattle/releases) or [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/quattle)<br>

## <small>Changelog</small>

**Updated Gems:** `concurrent-ruby` from 1.1.9 to 1.1.10* and `kramdown` from 2.3.1 to 2.3.2

* This [release](https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby/releases/tag/v1.1.10) sets the Ruby compatibility version at 2.2 which required me to do the same for the `quattle` gem.
